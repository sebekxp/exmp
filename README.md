This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About project

### ***This project was primarily developed as part of a recruitment task.***

The project is a basic implementation of a map discovery mechanism. It features simple gameplay mechanics that allow the player to navigate the map using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) as well as the W, A, S, and D keys. The objective of the game is to explore and uncover the entire map.

Upon launching the project, the player is greeted with an introduction page that sets the context and provides any necessary instructions or background information. This page serves as a starting point for the player's adventure.

Once the game begins, the player can control a character on the screen using the designated movement keys. As the player moves around the map, previously unexplored areas gradually become visible. This visibility progress is indicated through a progress indicator, which may take the form of a percentage or a visual representation of explored regions.

The map itself may consist of various terrain types, landmarks, obstacles, or points of interest. The player's exploration unveils these elements, allowing them to discover new areas, uncover hidden paths, or locate special items or rewards.

The gameplay continues until the player successfully uncovers 100% of the map. At this point, the game concludes, and the player is presented with an end page or a victory screen, celebrating their accomplishment.

While the project described is relatively simple, it serves as a foundation for more complex map discovery games or applications.
